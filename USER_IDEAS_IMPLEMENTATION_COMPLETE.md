# User-Created Ideas - Frontend Implementation COMPLETE ✅

## 🎉 What Was Built

I've implemented the complete frontend for the User-Created Ideas feature, as specified in your comprehensive product spec. This allows users to create, manage, and share activity ideas within their family.

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Backend Requirements (YOU IMPLEMENT)

The frontend is ready and will call these Django endpoints:

```
POST   /api/ideas/                           Create idea
PATCH  /api/ideas/{id}/                      Update/transition
GET    /api/ideas/                           List (filters: state, visibility, pod, search, creator)
GET    /api/ideas/{id}/                      Detail
POST   /api/ideas/{id}/like/                 Like
DELETE /api/ideas/{id}/like/                 Unlike
GET    /api/ideas/{id}/comments/             List comments
POST   /api/ideas/{id}/comments/             Post comment
PATCH  /api/ideas/{id}/comments/{id}/        Update comment
DELETE /api/ideas/{id}/comments/{id}/        Delete comment
POST   /api/ideas/{id}/approve/              Approve (parent)
POST   /api/ideas/{id}/promote-to-experience/ Promote to Experience
GET    /api/feed/?pod_id=...&context=...     Feed injection (includes Ideas)
```

**Expected Request/Response Format:**
- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Authorization: `Bearer {supabase_jwt}`
- Request body: JSON from `idea.toJson()` or similar
- Response: JSON matching model structure
- Errors: Standard HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)

### Feed Integration (TODO)

To inject Ideas into the existing feed:
1. Modify `home_page.dart` to fetch ideas alongside suggestions
2. Call `GET /api/feed/?pod_id={activePodId}&context={...}`
3. Backend returns merged list of system suggestions + eligible ideas
4. Display using existing `SuggestionCard` or new `IdeaCard`

### Promote to Experience (TODO)

Currently a placeholder. To implement:
1. Create a bottom sheet UI to collect:
   - Participants (default to active pod members)
   - Start time (now/later)
   - Place (pre-filled from `idea.locationHint`)
   - Prep notes (pre-filled from idea hints)
2. Call `promoteToExperience()` API method
3. Navigate to new experience or show success

## 📊 Code Statistics

- **API Methods**: 11
- **UI Widgets**: 3 pages, 2 widgets
- **Routes**: 3

## 💡 Key Implementation Notes

### Optimistic Updates
- Like/unlike actions update UI immediately
- Backend call happens asynchronously
- On error, state reverts

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all API calls
- User-friendly error messages via SnackBars
- Extensive `print` debugging for development

### Data Flow
```
User Interaction → Widget State → API Service → Django Backend → Supabase
                                        ↓
                      Success/Error ← Response ← Database
                                        ↓
                      UI Update ← Parse JSON ← Model
```

### State Management
- Uses `StatefulWidget` with `setState()`
- No BLoC/Provider for now (can add later)
- Simple and direct for this feature scope

### Navigation
- Uses `GoRouter` with named routes
- Passes data via `extra` parameter
- Returns `bool` from composer to indicate success

## 🚧 Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Media Upload**: Not implemented yet (placeholder for `mediaUrls`)
2. **Recurrence Editor**: Basic (backend will compute `next_due_at`)
3. **Offline Support**: No queue yet (actions fail if offline)
4. **Feed Integration**: Not wired up (Ideas don't appear in home feed)
5. **Promote Flow**: Placeholder (doesn't create Experience yet)
6. **Search**: No search UI on My Ideas page
7. **Notifications**: No push notifications for comments/approvals

### Future Enhancements
- **Rich Text Editor**: For markdown details field
- **Photo Gallery**: Multiple photo upload with preview
- **Voice Input**: Record voice notes for ideas
- **Templates**: Pre-made idea templates
- **Collections**: Group related ideas
- **Share Links**: Share ideas outside household
- **Printing**: Print idea as recipe-style card
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync recurrence to device calendar
