# Backend Setup for Member Rules

## Step 1: Create Supabase Table

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- File: supabase_member_rules.sql (already created in your project)
```

Just run the file `/Users/nash/onyxcompany/merryway/supabase_member_rules.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor.

## Step 2: Create Django Backend Files

### File 1: `family/models/member_rule.py`

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional
from datetime import datetime

class MemberRule(BaseModel):
    """Member rule model"""
    id: Optional[str] = None
    member_id: str
    rule_text: str
    category: Optional[str] = None
    created_at: Optional[datetime] = None
    updated_at: Optional[datetime] = None

class MemberRuleCreate(BaseModel):
    """Request model for creating a member rule"""
    member_id: str
    rule_text: str
    category: Optional[str] = None

class MemberRuleResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response model for member rules"""
    id: str
    member_id: str
    rule_text: str
    category: Optional[str] = None
    created_at: str
    updated_at: str
```

### File 2: `family/views/member_rules_view.py`

### File 3: Update `family/urls.py`

Add these URL patterns to your existing `family/urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import member_rules_view  # Add this import

urlpatterns = [
    # ... your existing URLs ...
    
    # Member Rules endpoints
    path('rules/member/', member_rules_view.get_member_rules_view, name='get_member_rules'),
    path('rules/member/add/', member_rules_view.add_member_rule_view, name='add_member_rule'),
    path('rules/member/delete/', member_rules_view.delete_member_rule_view, name='delete_member_rule'),
]
```

---

### File 4: Update `family/urls.py` (main app urls)

Make sure your main `urls.py` includes the family URLs:

```python
# In your main project urls.py
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    # ... other patterns ...
    path('api/v1/', include('family.urls')),  # This includes all family routes
]
```

---

## Step 3: Test the Endpoints

### Test 1: Get Member Rules (should return empty array initially)

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/rules/member/?member_id=YOUR_MEMBER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Test 2: Add a Member Rule

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/rules/member/add/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "member_id": "YOUR_MEMBER_ID",
    "rule_text": "No screen time after 8pm",
    "category": "screen_time"
  }'
```

### Test 3: Delete a Member Rule

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/rules/member/delete/?rule_id=RULE_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

---

## Step 4: Verify in Flutter App

1. Hot restart your Flutter app: `R`
2. Go to Settings â†’ Family Members â†’ Click on a member
3. Scroll down to the "Member Rules" section
4. Try adding a rule
5. The error should be gone! âœ…

## Quick Setup Checklist

- [ ] Run `supabase_member_rules.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Create `family/models/member_rule.py` with the models above
- [ ] Create `family/views/member_rules_view.py` with the view functions above
- [ ] Update `family/urls.py` to include the new routes
- [ ] Restart Django server: `python manage.py runserver`
- [ ] Test endpoints with curl or Postman
- [ ] Hot restart Flutter app and test the UI

## Done! ðŸŽ‰

The member rules feature should now work end-to-end.
