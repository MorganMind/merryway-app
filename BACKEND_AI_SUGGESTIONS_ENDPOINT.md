# Backend AI-Powered Suggestions Endpoint

## üéØ Purpose

When users type a natural language prompt in the search box (e.g., "I want something creative to do with the kids indoors"), the frontend calls this backend endpoint to generate personalized, AI-powered activity suggestions.

**Why backend?** 
- OpenAI API key stays secure on the backend
- Backend can combine AI reasoning with rule-based filtering
- Consistent with household policies and pod rules
- Better control over prompt engineering and response quality

## üêç Django Implementation

### 1. Add to `urls.py`

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import ai_suggestions_view

urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing patterns ...
    path('ai-suggestions/', ai_suggestions_view, name='ai_suggestions'),
]
```

### 2. Create `views/ai_suggestions.py`

```python
import os
import json

Guidelines:
- Be specific and creative with activity names (not generic)
- Rationale should reference their prompt, context (weather/time/day), and participants
- Consider ages when recommending activities
- Mix durations (quick 15-30min, medium 45-60min, long 90+ min)
- Prioritize activities that match the prompt closely
- If weather is rainy, suggest indoor activities
- If it's evening, avoid high-energy outdoor activities
- Consider the day of week (weekends = more time, weekdays = quicker)
- Respect any pod rules provided
- Make it feel magical and exciting!"""

### Test with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ai-suggestions/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "household_id": "0d6a2a77-d45a-4ebf-8437-76c8343e21a6",
    "prompt": "something creative to do with the kids indoors",
    "context": {
      "weather": "rainy",
      "time_of_day": "afternoon",
      "day_of_week": "saturday"
    },
    "participants": ["member-id-1", "member-id-2"]
  }'
```

### Expected Response:

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "activity_name": "Build a Blanket Fort Art Studio",
      "category": "creative",
      "duration": 45,

## üé® Example Prompts & Expected Behavior

| User Prompt | Expected AI Response |
|------------|---------------------|
| "something active for the kids" | Outdoor games, sports, playground activities |
| "we're bored and it's raining" | Indoor crafts, games, baking, fort building |
| "educational activity for preschooler" | Learning games, nature exploration, counting/letters |
| "family bonding time" | Board games, cooking together, movie night setup |
| "quick 15 minute activity" | Short games, dance party, scavenger hunt |
| "creative project for older kids" | Art projects, DIY building, coding, music |
| "free activity no supplies" | Imaginative play, outdoor exploration, storytelling |

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

1. ‚úÖ OpenAI API key stored on backend
2. ‚úÖ Endpoint requires authentication
3. ‚úÖ Only returns suggestions for user's household
4. ‚úÖ Respects pod rules and family policies
5. ‚úÖ No sensitive data sent to OpenAI (only ages, generic interests)
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider logging prompts for quality improvement (with user consent)

---

## üìù Frontend Changes Made

**File**: `lib/modules/home/pages/home_page.dart`

**Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Added `_fetchAISuggestions()` method
- ‚úÖ Modified `_fetchNewSuggestion()` to detect custom prompts and route to AI endpoint
- ‚úÖ Added imports for `http`, `dart:convert`, and `Environment`
- ‚úÖ Sends full context (weather, time, day, participants, pod) to backend
- ‚úÖ Displays AI-generated suggestions in standard suggestion cards
- ‚úÖ Shows user-friendly error messages if AI generation fails

**User Experience**:
1. User types "something creative to do with the kids" in search box
2. User presses Enter or clicks Send icon
3. Frontend shows loading state
4. Backend generates AI suggestions (takes 2-5 seconds)
5. Frontend displays 3 personalized suggestions with rationales
6. User can tap "Try This!" to make it an experience

## üöÄ Benefits Over Rule-Based System

| Feature | Rule-Based | AI-Powered |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Flexibility** | Fixed patterns only | Understands natural language |
| **Creativity** | Pre-defined activities | Generates novel suggestions |
| **Context Understanding** | Basic filters | Deep semantic understanding |
| **Personalization** | Limited to tags | Considers full family context |
| **Rationale Quality** | Generic | Specific to user's request |
| **User Engagement** | Moderate | High (feels magical!) |

---

## ‚ö° Quick Setup

1. Copy the view code to your Django app (`views/ai_suggestions.py`)
2. Add the URL route to `urls.py`
3. `pip install openai supabase`
4. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` env vars
5. Restart Django server
6. Test with the curl command above

**Frontend is already updated and ready to use!** üéâ

---

## üéØ Future Enhancements

1. **Caching**: Cache common prompts to reduce OpenAI costs
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Mix AI-generated + rule-based suggestions
3. **Learning**: Track which AI suggestions users actually do
4. **Multi-turn**: Allow follow-up prompts ("make it shorter", "outdoor version")
5. **Cost Control**: Rate limiting, fallback to rule-based if quota exceeded
6. **Quality Scoring**: Score AI suggestions before returning to user
7. **Embedding Search**: Use OpenAI embeddings to find similar activities in database

---

## üí° Cost Considerations

**OpenAI Pricing** (GPT-3.5-turbo):
- Input: ~$0.0005 per 1K tokens
- Output: ~$0.0015 per 1K tokens
- Average request: ~700 tokens = **$0.001 per suggestion** (90% cheaper than GPT-4!)

**Cost Mitigation**:
- Cache common prompts for instant responses
- Rate limit to 20 requests per user per hour
- Fallback to rule-based system after quota
- Consider upgrading to GPT-4 for premium users only

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Restart Django server

### "Failed to parse AI response"
- Check OpenAI response in Django logs
- Adjust temperature (lower = more structured)
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff

### Suggestions don't match prompt
- Improve system prompt with more examples
- Add few-shot examples to prompt
- Increase temperature for more creativity

### Slow response times (>5s)
- Already using GPT-3.5-turbo (fast!)
- Reduce max_tokens in request if needed
- Implement caching for common prompts
- Check network latency to OpenAI
