# ⚡ Quick Render Deploy Fix

## The Problem
Render doesn't have Flutter installed → Build failed ❌

## The Solution
Use Docker! 🐳

## Files Created
✅ `Dockerfile` - Builds Flutter web app using official Flutter image
✅ `nginx.conf` - Serves the app efficiently
✅ `.dockerignore` - Optimizes build size
✅ `.env` - Your secure keys (gitignored)
✅ `.env.example` - Template for team

## What You Need to Do on Render

### Step 1: Update Your Render Service
1. Go to your Render service settings
2. Change **Environment** from "Native" to **Docker** 
3. That's the key change! ⚠️

### Step 2: Keep Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Render dashboard:
- ✅ `SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- ✅ `API_URL`

### Step 3: Push & Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Docker deployment"
git push origin master
```

Render will auto-deploy! 🚀

## How It Works
1. Render detects `Dockerfile`
2. Uses official Flutter Docker image
3. Creates `.env` from your Render env vars
4. Builds Flutter web app
5. Serves with Nginx on port 80
6. Done! ✨

## Expected Build Time
- First build: ~5-10 minutes
- Subsequent builds: ~3-5 minutes (cached layers)

## Verify It Worked
✅ Build logs show "Flutter" and "nginx" (not "command not found")
✅ App loads at your Render URL
✅ No CORS errors in browser console
