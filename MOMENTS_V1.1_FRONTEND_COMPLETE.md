## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Data Flow:**

```dart
// Load upcoming items
final upcoming = await _repository.listExperiences(
  householdId,
  status: 'planned',
);

// Calculate time to start
final minutesToStart = startAt.difference(now).inMinutes;
final withinHour = 0 <= minutesToStart <= 60;

// Load completed items (experiences + moments)
final completed = await _repository.listExperiences(
  householdId,
  status: 'done',
);

final moments = await supabase
  .from('merry_moments')
  .select()
  .eq('household_id', householdId);

// Enrich with media
final media = await supabase
  .from('media')
  .select('id, storage_path')
  .eq('experience_id', experienceId);

final coverUrl = supabase.storage
  .from('merry-moments')
  .getPublicUrl(media.first['storage_path']);
```

### **State Management:**
- `_upcomingItems` - List of upcoming experiences
- `_completedItems` - List of completed experiences + moments
- `_dismissedPhotoPrompts` - Set of IDs where user dismissed prompt
- `_isLoading` - Loading state

### **Performance:**
- Uses `RefreshIndicator` for pull-to-refresh
- Lazy loading with `ListView.builder`
- Efficient image loading with `Image.network`
- Optimistic UI updates

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Phase 1)

### **Current Implementation:**
Uses existing data structure and manual media queries. For production:

**TODO (Backend):**
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/v1/moments/upcoming/` endpoint
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/v1/moments/completed/` endpoint
- [ ] Add `time_to_start_minutes` computed field
- [ ] Add `cover_media_url` enrichment
- [ ] Add `review_summary` enrichment
- [ ] Add permission flags

**Frontend Updates (After Backend):**
```dart
// Replace manual queries with API calls
final response = await http.get(
  Uri.parse('${Environment.apiUrl}/moments/completed/?household_id=$householdId'),
  headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $token'},
);

final items = jsonDecode(response.body)['items'];
```

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### **Phase 2:**
- [ ] Hero transitions (cover → detail)
- [ ] Monthly highlights
- [ ] Activity heatmap
- [ ] Search/filter
- [ ] Batch photo upload

### **Phase 3:**
