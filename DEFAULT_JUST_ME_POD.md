# Default "Just Me" Pod Feature

## Overview

Every authenticated user automatically gets a default pod called **"Just Me"** with the description **"On my Merryway"**. This pod is personal to each household and only visible to that household's members (via Row Level Security).

---

## üéØ Purpose

The "Just Me" pod allows users to quickly get activity suggestions for solo activities or mark themselves for individual experiences. It provides a convenient default for single-person planning.

---

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. Automatic Creation
- **Created on Onboarding**: When a user completes onboarding and creates a household, the "Just Me" pod is automatically created.
- **Created for Existing Users**: When existing users open the home page, the system checks if the "Just Me" pod exists. If not, it creates it automatically.

### 2. Pod Properties
- **Name**: `Just Me`
- **Description**: `On my Merryway`
- **Icon**: üéí
- **Color**: `#B4D7E8` (Soft Blue)
- **Initial Members**: Empty (user can add themselves via account linking)

### 3. Account Linking Integration
- **Auto-Add on Link**: When a user links their authenticated account to a family member, that member is automatically added to the "Just Me" pod.
- **Auto-Remove on Unlink**: If the linking logic supports unlinking (future feature), the member will be removed from the "Just Me" pod.

---

## üì¶ Implementation

### Service: `DefaultPodService`

**Location**: `lib/modules/family/services/default_pod_service.dart`

#### Methods:

##### `ensureDefaultPodExists(String householdId)`
Checks if the "Just Me" pod exists for a household. If not, creates it.

**Usage**:
```dart
await DefaultPodService.ensureDefaultPodExists(householdId);
```

**Called in**:
- `OnboardingPage` - After household and members are created
- `HomePage._loadHouseholdId()` - When home page loads (for existing users)

##### `addCurrentUserToDefaultPod({required String householdId, required String memberId})`
Adds a family member to the "Just Me" pod. If the pod doesn't exist, creates it first.

**Usage**:
```dart
await DefaultPodService.addCurrentUserToDefaultPod(
  householdId: householdId,
  memberId: member.id,
);
```

**Called in**:
- `SimpleSettingsPage._linkMemberToCurrentUser()` - After user links their account to a member

##### `removeCurrentUserFromDefaultPod({required String householdId, required String memberId})`
Removes a family member from the "Just Me" pod.

**Usage** (future):
```dart
await DefaultPodService.removeCurrentUserFromDefaultPod(
  householdId: householdId,
  memberId: member.id,
);
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database

### Table: `pods`

The "Just Me" pod is stored in the standard `pods` table with these properties:

```json
{
  "id": "generated-uuid",
  "household_id": "household-uuid",
  "name": "Just Me",
  "description": "On my Merryway",
  "member_ids": [],  // Empty initially, populated when user links account
  "icon": "üéí",
  "color": "#B4D7E8",
  "created_at": "2025-10-12T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-12T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Row Level Security (RLS)

The "Just Me" pod is protected by the same RLS policies as all other pods:

```sql
-- Users can only view pods from their own household
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their household's pods"
  ON pods FOR SELECT
  USING (
    household_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM households WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

This ensures each household's "Just Me" pod is only visible to members of that household.
