# AI Features Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

You now have **two AI-powered features** in Merryway that keep your OpenAI API key secure on the backend:

1. **AI Journal Parsing** - Natural language input for manual Merry Moments
2. **AI Activity Suggestions** - Smart, context-aware activity recommendations

Both features follow the same secure architecture: frontend calls your Django backend, which then calls OpenAI.

---

## ✅ Feature 1: AI Journal Parsing

### What It Does
Users can create Merry Moments by typing natural language like:
> "Today me and Sarah went to the park at 2pm, then the whole family went for pizza at 6pm"

The AI parses this into structured data:
- Title: "Park Day & Pizza"
- Description: Brief summary
- Participants: ["Nash", "Sarah"]
- Place: "Park"
- Occurred At: ISO datetime

### Frontend Changes
**File**: `lib/modules/experiences/widgets/add_manual_moment_sheet.dart`
- ✅ Now calls `POST /api/v1/parse-journal-entry/`
- ✅ Removed direct OpenAI API call
- ✅ Sends text + family member names to backend
- ✅ Receives parsed JSON directly

### Backend Requirements
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/parse-journal-entry/`
**Documentation**: `BACKEND_JOURNAL_PARSING_ENDPOINT.md`

**Quick Setup**:
```bash
pip install openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## ✅ Feature 2: AI Activity Suggestions

### What It Does
Users type what they want to do in the search box:
> "something creative to do with the kids indoors"

The AI generates 3 personalized activity suggestions that:
- Match the user's intent
- Consider weather, time of day, day of week
- Account for participant ages and interests
- Respect pod rules
- Include detailed rationales

### Example AI Response
```
🎨 Build a Blanket Fort Art Studio
Duration: 45 min | Indoor | Ages 4+
"Perfect for a rainy Saturday afternoon! Kids can build the fort 
together, then use it as a cozy creative space for drawing or crafts."
```

### Frontend Changes
**File**: `lib/modules/home/pages/home_page.dart`
- ✅ Added `_fetchAISuggestions()` method
- ✅ Modified `_fetchNewSuggestion()` to detect custom prompts
- ✅ Added imports for `http`, `dart:convert`, `Environment`
- ✅ Automatically routes to AI when user enters a prompt

### User Flow
1. User types prompt in "What would you like to do?" field
2. User presses Enter or clicks Send icon  
3. Frontend calls `POST /api/v1/ai-suggestions/`
4. Backend uses OpenAI to generate suggestions (2-5 seconds)
5. Frontend displays suggestions with rationales
6. User can tap "Try This!" or "Make it an Experience"

### Backend Requirements
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/ai-suggestions/`
**Documentation**: `BACKEND_AI_SUGGESTIONS_ENDPOINT.md`

**Quick Setup**:
```bash
pip install openai supabase
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export SUPABASE_URL=https://...
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=...
```

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Before (Insecure)
```
Flutter App → OpenAI API
  ❌ API key exposed in frontend code
  ❌ No rate limiting
  ❌ No logging
```

### After (Secure)
```
Flutter App → Django Backend → OpenAI API
  ✅ API key only on backend
  ✅ JWT authentication required
  ✅ Rate limiting possible
  ✅ Request logging & monitoring
  ✅ Cost control
```

## 📊 Cost Estimates (GPT-3.5-turbo)

### AI Journal Parsing
- **Usage**: ~500 tokens per parse
- **Cost**: ~$0.0005 per entry
- **Volume**: ~10 manual moments per household per month
- **Monthly Cost**: $0.005 per household

### AI Activity Suggestions
- **Usage**: ~700 tokens per suggestion request
- **Cost**: ~$0.001 per request
- **Volume**: ~20 AI searches per household per month
- **Monthly Cost**: $0.02 per household

### Total Monthly Cost (90% cheaper than GPT-4!)
- **Per Household**: ~$0.025/month
- **100 Households**: ~$2.50/month
- **1000 Households**: ~$25/month
- **10,000 Households**: ~$250/month

### Cost Optimization Options
1. ✅ Already using GPT-3.5-turbo (optimal!)
2. Cache common prompts for instant responses
3. Rate limit to 20 AI requests per user per hour
4. Hybrid: Mix AI + rule-based suggestions
5. Premium tier with GPT-4 for power users

---

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Generic, rule-based suggestions
- Limited by pre-defined activities
- No understanding of user intent
- Manual data entry for moments

### After
- **Contextual**: Understands "I want something creative"
- **Personalized**: Considers family's unique situation
- **Natural**: "today we went to the park" → structured data
- **Magical**: Feels like Mary Poppins is helping!
- **Detailed**: Rich rationales explain WHY each suggestion fits

## 🧪 Testing

### Test AI Journal Parsing
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/parse-journal-entry/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Today me and Sarah went to the park",
    "family_member_names": ["Nash", "Sarah", "Emma"]
  }'
```

### Test AI Suggestions
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ai-suggestions/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "household_id": "uuid-here",
    "prompt": "something creative to do with the kids",
    "context": {
      "weather": "rainy",
      "time_of_day": "afternoon",
      "day_of_week": "saturday"
    }
  }'
```

## 📋 Backend Implementation Checklist

### Journal Parsing
- [ ] Create `views/parse_journal_entry.py`
- [ ] Add URL route
- [ ] `pip install openai`
- [ ] Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var
- [ ] Test with curl
- [ ] Test in app (Moments page → "Journal" button)

### AI Suggestions
- [ ] Create `views/ai_suggestions.py`
- [ ] Add URL route
- [ ] `pip install openai supabase`
- [ ] Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
- [ ] Test with curl
- [ ] Test in app (Home page → type in search box)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "household_id violates not-null constraint"
- **Issue**: Metrics update missing `household_id`
- **Fix**: In your `create_merry_moment` view, ensure:
  ```python
  FamilyHealthMetrics.objects.update_or_create(
      household_id=household_id,  # ← Add this!
      defaults={'last_activity_date': ...}
  )
  ```

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- **Fix**: Set environment variable and restart Django

### AI suggestions are slow (>5s)
- **Note**: Already using GPT-3.5-turbo (typically 1-3s response)
- **Fix**: Check network latency, implement caching

### AI responses don't match prompt well
- **Fix**: Adjust system prompt, add examples, tune temperature

3. **Monitor Usage**
   - Track OpenAI API costs
   - Log popular prompts
   - Identify opportunities for caching

4. **Optimize**
   - Consider GPT-3.5-turbo for cost savings
   - Implement caching for common prompts
   - Add rate limiting
