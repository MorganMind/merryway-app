# ✅ Supabase Integration Complete!

Your Merryway app now saves **everything to Supabase** instead of local storage!

---

## 🎯 **What Was Changed:**

### **1. Database Tables Created**
Run the SQL in `supabase_setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:
- ✅ `households` table - stores household name linked to user
- ✅ `family_members` table - stores all family members with activities
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies - users can only access their own data
- ✅ Automatic `updated_at` triggers

### **2. Onboarding Flow Updated** ✅
**File:** `lib/modules/onboarding/pages/onboarding_page.dart`
- Saves household to Supabase `households` table
- Saves all family members to Supabase `family_members` table
- Caches household ID in local storage for quick access
- Shows error messages if Supabase save fails

### **3. Settings Page Updated** ✅
**File:** `lib/modules/settings/pages/simple_settings_page.dart`
- Loads household name from Supabase
- Loads family members from Supabase (with avatars, roles, activities)
- **Add Member** saves directly to Supabase
- **Remove Member** deletes from Supabase
- Displays member count dynamically
- Shows error messages on failures

### **4. Home Page Updated** ✅
**File:** `lib/modules/home/pages/home_page.dart`
- Loads household and family members from Supabase on startup
- Displays household name
- Populates participant chips from Supabase data
- Participant selection syncs with Supabase members

---

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

### **1. Run the SQL Setup** (Required)
```bash
# In your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
# Copy and paste the contents of: supabase_setup.sql
```

This will create the `households` and `family_members` tables.

### **2. Test the Flow**
1. **Sign up/Log in** → Creates user in Supabase Auth
2. **Onboarding** → Creates household and members in Supabase
3. **Home Page** → Loads from Supabase and shows participant chips
4. **Settings** → View/add/remove members (all saved to Supabase)

## 🔍 **What's Stored Where:**

| Data                  | Location                | Purpose                          |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Household Name        | Supabase `households`   | Primary source of truth          |
| Family Members        | Supabase `family_members` | Primary source of truth        |
| Household ID (cache)  | Local Storage           | Quick access (re-loaded from Supabase) |
| Participant Selection | Local Storage           | UI state (context-specific)      |
| Participant Presets   | Local Storage           | UI state (user preferences)      |

## 🛠️ **How It Works:**

### **Onboarding:**
```
User fills form → Taps "Create" 
  → Saves to Supabase households table
  → Saves members to Supabase family_members table
  → Caches ID locally
  → Navigates to Home
```

### **Loading Data:**
```
App starts → Checks Supabase auth
  → Loads household by user_id
  → Loads family members by household_id
  → Displays in UI
```

### **Adding Member:**
```
Settings → Add Member → Fill form
  → Saves to Supabase family_members
  → Reloads from Supabase
  → Shows in list
```

## ✨ **Benefits:**

- **✅ Data persists across devices** - Log in anywhere, see your family
- **✅ No backend server needed** - Supabase handles everything
- **✅ Real-time sync ready** - Can add Supabase Realtime later
- **✅ Secure** - RLS policies ensure users only see their data
- **✅ Scalable** - Hosted Supabase handles growth

---

## 🔐 **Security:**

- **Row Level Security (RLS) enabled** on both tables
- Users can only:
  - View their own households and members
  - Create households for themselves
  - Update/delete their own data
- No data leakage between users

---

## 📊 **Testing in Supabase Dashboard:**

After onboarding, check your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Table Editor** → `households` → See your household
2. **Table Editor** → `family_members` → See all members
3. **Authentication** → Users → See your logged-in user

---

## 🚀 **Your App is Live at:**

**http://localhost:8686**

**Participant chips will now appear** after you:
1. Complete onboarding with family members, OR
2. Add members in Settings

---

## 🎉 **Ready to Go!**

Everything is saved to Supabase now. Just run the SQL setup and test the flow!
